Set of all such possible outcomes is the sample space (\(\Omega\)) of the experiment. A subset of the sample space, which is the collection of all possible outcomes is called an event.</p> <h3 id="example">Example</h3> <p>Consider an experiment involving ten successive coin tosses.</p> <p><strong>Experiment</strong>: Ten successive coin tosses.</p> <p><strong>Outcomes</strong>: Each outcome is a \(10\) character string with each character is either a \(H\) or \(T\).</p> \[\begin{align*} \omega_1 &amp;= HHTTTHHTHH \\ \omega_2 &amp;= HTHHTTTHHH \end{align*}\] <p><strong>Sample Space</strong>: Set of all such outcomes is the sample space \(\Omega\)</p> \[\Omega = \{ HHHHHHHHHH, HTHHTTTHHH, TTTTTTTTTT, \cdots \}\] <p>The total number of possible outcomes of the sample space is, \(\vert\Omega\vert = 2^{10} = 1024\).</p> <p><strong>Events</strong>: An event is a subset of the sample space. Some examples are:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>First Head Occurs on the 3rd Toss</strong>: The set of outcomes where the first Head appears on the 3rd toss:</p> \[E_1 = \{\omega \in \Omega : \omega = TTHTTTTTTT \text{ or } \omega = TTHHHHHHHH \text{ and so on.}\}\] </li> <li> <p><strong>Exactly 4 Heads in 10 Tosses</strong>: The set of outcomes with exactly 4 Heads: \(E_2 = \{\omega \in \Omega : \text{Number of } H \text{ in } \omega = 4\}\)</p> </li> </ul> <p>The immediate question that arises is how all this fits into the defnition of a random variable. Now let’s formally define a random variable \(X\):</p> \[\begin{equation} X(\omega) : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \end{equation}\] <p>Here:</p> <ul> <li>\(\Omega\) represents the sample space, which is the set of all possible outcomes of the random experiment.</li> <li>\(\mathbb{R}\) is the set of real numbers.</li> <li>\(X(\omega)\) represents the random variable that maps the outcome (\(\omega\)) to the real line (\(\mathbb{R}\)). It is also a real-valued function.</li> </ul> <p>A random variable acts as a bridge, translating outcomes (\(\omega\)) into numerical values (\(\mathbb{R}\)).</p> <ul> <li>The outcomes (\(\omega\)) that belong in the sample space (\(\Omega\)), correspond to the measure (distribution) that we want to study mathematically.</li> <li>The measure is already present in these outcomes (\(\omega\)) and we define a random variable (\(X\)) to map that measure to the Real line (\(\mathbb{R}\)).</li> </ul> <p><strong>Q. What is the purpose of this mapping?</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this mapping is to study the statistical properties of the random variable \(X\), which encapsulates the behavior of outcomes in the sample space. In statistical terms, the properties of a random variable are often described using measures like mean, variance, and higher-order moments. These measures summarize key aspects of the data, such as its central tendency (mean) and variability (variance). The moments of a random variable \(X\) like mean (\(\mathbb{E}[X]\)) and variance (\(\text{Var}(X)\)) provide critical insights into the distribution of \(X\). Higher-order moments (e.g., skewness and kurtosis) offer a more nuanced understanding of the behavior of \(X\). This mathematical representation allows us to gain significant insights into the behavior of a random variable through its moments.The exercise of creating a random variable is about defining a mapping from a sample space (\(\Omega\)) to the real numbers (\(\mathbb{R}\)).</p> <p>For example, if we define the random variable \(X\) as the number of heads in 2 successive coin flips, then \(X\)(No of Heads) \(= \{0,1,2\}\). The mapping defined by the random variable \(X\) induces a distribution from the underlying probability measure \(P\) on the sample space \(\Omega\). In this example we can say that \(X\) follows a Binomial distribution. This is because the random variable \(X\) transforms the distribution on the sample space \(\Omega\) into a distribution on the real line.</p> <h2 id="probability-mass-function">Probability Mass Function</h2> <p>Characterizes the random variable through probabilities of values it can take. Suppose \(X\) is the random variable. What is the</p> <p><strong>Q. What does it mean when we say: The random variable \(X\) has a binomial distribution?</strong></p> <hr/> <h1 id="lets-deep-dive">Let’s Deep Dive</h1> <p>In the previous section we understood how a random variable is defined through an example, and the process appeared straightforward. However, this simplicity arose because of the implicit property of the sample space being countably finite. The sample space could also have been countably infinite or uncountably infinite. Let’s see what these terms mean and how it helps in revising the definition of a random variable.</p> <h2 id="countably-finite-set">Countably Finite Set</h2> <p>A <strong>countably finite set</strong> is a set with a finite number of elements and can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the first \(n\) positive integers, where \(n\) is finite.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Example</strong>: The set \(A = \{2, 4, 6, 8\}\) has 4 elements that correspond to the natural numbers \(\{1, 2, 3, 4\}\).</li> </ul> <h2 id="countably-infinite-set">Countably Infinite Set</h2> <p>A <strong>countably infinite set</strong> is a set with infinitely many elements, but these elements can still be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers (\(\mathbb{N}\)).</p> <ul> <li><strong>Definition</strong>: A set is countably infinite if there exists a bijection (one-to-one and onto mapping) between the set and the set of natural numbers \(\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \dots\}\).</li> <li><strong>Examples</strong>: <ul> <li>The set of all natural numbers: \(\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, \dots\}\).</li> <li>The set of all integers: \(\mathbb{Z} = \{\dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \dots\}\). - \(\mathbb{Z}\) can be mapped to \(\mathbb{N}\) using: \(f(n) = \begin{cases} 2n &amp; \text{if } n &gt; 0 \\ -2n + 1 &amp; \text{if } n \leq 0 \end{cases}\)</li> <li>The set of even numbers, \(E = \{2, 4, 6, 8, \dots\}\) maps \(E \to \mathbb{N}\) with \(f(n) = 2n\).</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2 id="uncountably-infinite-set">Uncountably Infinite Set</h2> <p>A set is <strong>uncountably infinite</strong> if it contains infinitely many elements that cannot be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers (\(\mathbb{N}\)). In other words, the set is too large to be enumerated, even in principle.</p> <p><strong>Properties</strong></p> <ul> <li>An uncountably infinite set has a <strong>greater cardinality</strong> than countable sets like \(\mathbb{N}\) or \(\mathbb{Z}\).</li> <li>The term “uncountable” reflects the impossibility of listing all elements of the set, even using an infinite process.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Example</strong></p> <p>The interval \([0, 1] \subset \mathbb{R}\) is uncountably infinite. This can be proven by Cantor’s diagonal argument, which demonstrates that no list can include all real numbers.</p> <hr/> <h1 id="revisit-the-definition">Revisit the definition</h1> <p>Now that we understand different types of sample spaces, let’s revisit our definition of a random variable as presented in Equation (1):</p> \[X(\omega) : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\] <p>Here, \(\omega\) represents an outcome within the sample space \(\Omega\). The sample space (\(\Omega\)) can vary based on its cardinality and can be:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Countably Finite</strong>: For instance, when \(\Omega\) consists of outcomes from a finite experiment like flipping a coin a fixed number of times.</li> <li><strong>Countably Infinite</strong>: For example, when \(\Omega\) includes outcomes indexed by natural numbers, such as set of all integers.</li> <li><strong>Uncountably Infinite</strong>: Such as when \(\Omega\) is the set of all possible real numbers, like measuring precise temperatures or distances. These outcomes form a continuous sample space, which is inherently uncountable.</li> </ul> <p>To build our concept further, we need to get a grasp of certain fundamental theory in mathematics:</p> <ul> <li>Set Theory</li> <li>Axioms of Probability</li> <li>Probability Space</li> </ul> <p>We will introduce these concepts as we refine our construction of the definition of a random variable.</p> <h1 id="references">References</h1> <ol> <li>Gubner, John A. <em>Probability and Random Processes for Electrical and Computer Engineers</em>.
